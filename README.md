# File Handling Tasks - Python

This repository contains two simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic file handling:

## Task 1 - Read from File
- Opens and reads a file named `sample.txt`
- Prints each line
- Handles the case if the file is missing

## Task 2 - Write, Append, and Read File
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`
- Appends additional input to the same file
- Reads and prints the full contents of the file
